# Python assignment - DATA Analyst @ Silvr
The goal here is to read two files containing basic information about some enterprises. The file **revenue_clean.csv** contains the cash flow(column name **amount** ) and the dates (column **day_date**) a given enterprise (column name **enterprise_id**) has received. The file **expenses_clean.csv** contains the advertisement expenses (column name **amount**) an enterprise pays for a given platform (campaing column name **platform**) and the date it was done (column name **date**).
We recommend you to have ready a workstation with some kind of interactive python and your preferred libraries for analyzing and plotting data (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc) of course you can use other libraries, in that case, plese provide a requirements file. We recommend to spend about two hours, yet this up to you.

# What is asked
On the expenses data-set there is a column called platform
1. Tell us which platform is the one collecting the most campaigns?
2. What is the less used platform? Make a campaigns bar plot with all platforms.
3. What platform is collecting the most money?
4. What is the platform collecting the less money? Make an expenses bar plot with all platforms.
5. Can you draw conclusions?

On the revenues data-set, 
1. select all the enterprises having at least a whole year (Spawning more than 365 days, starting on any day) of revenue **and** expenses. Select that whole year, what are the enterprises having the biggest revenue and the lowest revenue?
